## Time Series Forecasting: Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

Here we are building a complete time series forecasting project using LSTM neural networks to predict stock prices. We'll use real API data and create a deployable application.

What we Built:
✅ Real-time data fetching from Yahoo Finance API
✅ LSTM neural network for time series forecasting
✅ Interactive visualizations with Plotly
✅ Future price predictions
✅ Model performance metrics
✅ Complete Streamlit web app

Key Features:

Predict any stock symbol

Adjustable lookback period

Future day predictions

Interactive charts

Performance metrics

Next: We Try it with different stocks (TSLA, GOOGL, MSFT) or add more features like volume analysis and technical indicators! 🚀
